Generate {{ count }} numerical/problem-solving questions for practice/exam mode:

Subject: {{ subject }}
Goal: {{ goal }}
Subtopic: {{ subtopic_title }}
Context: {{ context }}
Difficulty Level: Mixed (easy, medium, hard)

Create practical problems that require calculation, analysis, or numerical reasoning. Each question should:
1. Present a realistic problem or scenario requiring calculation
2. Have a specific numerical answer (number, percentage, formula result, etc.)
3. Include step-by-step solution in the explanation
4. Provide a helpful hint that guides thinking without revealing the answer
5. Test understanding of {{ subtopic_title }} concepts through quantitative analysis

Question types to include:
- Mathematical calculations and formulas
- Percentage/ratio problems
- Data analysis and interpretation
- Unit conversions
- Statistical calculations
- Problem-solving with given parameters

Format the output as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question_text": "Detailed problem statement with specific values and requirements. Calculate: [specific request]",
      "correct_answer": "42.5",
      "explanation": "Step-by-step solution: Step 1: ... Step 2: ... Final answer: 42.5",
      "hint": "Consider using [specific approach/formula] to solve this problem (only if hints enabled: {{ hints_enabled }})",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "unit": "%",
      "answer_format": "decimal"
    }
  ]
}
```

Make problems realistic and applicable to {{ goal }}. Ensure answers are precise and calculable.
