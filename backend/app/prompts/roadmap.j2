Generate a comprehensive learning roadmap based on the following parameters:
Subject: {{ subject }}
Goal: {{ goal }}
Time Value: {{ time_value }}
Time Unit: {{ time_unit }}

Your response should be a clear, well-structured learning roadmap. Please use a hierarchical format to outline the roadmap, with modules, topics, and sub-topics.

All sub-topics should have a "learn" and "quiz" section.

For sub-topics that involve a practical coding skill, please also indicate that it should have a "code challenge" section.

Please indicate these sections by appending "(learn, quiz, code challenge)", "(learn, quiz)", etc. to the sub-topic title.

For example:

**Roadmap Title:**

**Roadmap Description:**

**Module 1: [Module Title]**
* Timeline: [Timeline for the module]

  * **Topic 1: [Topic Title]**
    * Sub-topic 1: [Sub-topic Title] (learn, quiz)
    * Sub-topic 2: [Sub-topic Title] (learn, quiz, code challenge)

  * **Topic 2: [Topic Title]**
    * Sub-topic 1: [Sub-topic Title] (learn, quiz)

**Module 2: [Module Title]**
* Timeline: [Timeline for the module]

  * **Topic 1: [Topic Title]**
    * Sub-topic 1: [Sub-topic Title] (learn, quiz)
