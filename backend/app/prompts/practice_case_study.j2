Generate {{ count }} case study/scenario-based questions for practice/exam mode:

Subject: {{ subject }}
Goal: {{ goal }}
Subtopic: {{ subtopic_title }}
Context: {{ context }}
Difficulty Level: Mixed (easy, medium, hard)

Create realistic scenarios that require applying {{ subtopic_title }} knowledge in practical contexts. Each question should:
1. Present a detailed, realistic scenario or case study
2. Require analysis, evaluation, and application of concepts
3. Have multiple plausible options with one best answer
4. Test critical thinking and practical application
5. Include comprehensive explanation of reasoning

Scenario types to include:
- Real-world business/professional situations
- Problem-solving in practical contexts
- Decision-making with multiple factors
- Analysis of complex situations
- Application of theoretical concepts to practice

Format the output as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question_text": "Detailed scenario description...\n\nGiven this situation, what would be the most effective approach?",
      "options": [
        {"id": "A", "text": "First strategic option with reasoning"},
        {"id": "B", "text": "Second approach with different methodology"},
        {"id": "C", "text": "Third solution addressing key factors (correct)"},
        {"id": "D", "text": "Fourth alternative with different priorities"}
      ],
      "correct_answer_id": "C",
      "explanation": "Detailed analysis of why option C is most effective, considering the scenario constraints and {{ subtopic_title }} principles. Analysis of why other options are less optimal.",
      "hint": "Consider the key factors: [mention 2-3 critical elements] when evaluating options (only if hints enabled: {{ hints_enabled }})",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "scenario_type": "professional_application"
    }
  ]
}
```

Ensure scenarios are relevant to {{ goal }} and test deep understanding of {{ subtopic_title }}.
