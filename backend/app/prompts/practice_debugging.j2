Generate {{ count }} debugging questions optimized for interactive code editor with live execution feedback:

Subject: {{ subject }}
Goal: {{ goal }}
Subtopic: {{ subtopic_title }}
Context: {{ context }}
Difficulty Level: Mixed (easy, medium, hard)

Create realistic debugging scenarios designed for an IDE-like environment where students can:
- View buggy code in Monaco Editor with syntax highlighting
- Edit the code directly to fix errors
- Run the code to see compilation/execution results
- Get immediate feedback on their fixes

Each question should present complete, runnable code with intentional bugs that students must find and fix:

1. **Executable Buggy Code**: Provide working code structure with specific errors that prevent proper execution
2. **Realistic Scenarios**: Use real-world programming contexts relevant to {{ subtopic_title }}
3. **Testable Errors**: Include bugs that can be detected through code execution and testing
4. **Educational Value**: Focus on errors that teach important programming concepts
5. **Live Feedback**: Design code that provides clear success/failure feedback when run

**Enhanced Error Types for Interactive Debugging:**
- Syntax errors that prevent compilation (missing punctuation, incorrect operators)
- Logic errors that produce wrong outputs (incorrect conditions, off-by-one errors)
- Runtime errors (null references, array bounds, type mismatches)
- Algorithm errors (incorrect sorting logic, wrong mathematical operations)
- Best practice violations (inefficient code, security issues)

**Code Structure Requirements:**
- Include complete, contextual code (functions with test cases)
- Add console output statements to verify correct behavior
- Ensure code is 15-25 lines for optimal editor viewing
- Include realistic variable names and meaningful logic
- Add test cases at the end to demonstrate expected vs actual behavior

Format the output as a JSON object:

    {
      "id": 1,
      "question_text": "This function is supposed to find the maximum number in a list and return its index, but it contains bugs. Run the code to see the error, then fix it:",
      "code_snippet": "def find_max_index(numbers):\n    \"\"\"Find the index of the maximum number in a list\"\"\"\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        return -1\n    \n    max_value = numbers[0]\n    max_index = 0\n    \n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        if numbers[i] > max_value:\n            max_value = numbers[i]\n            # Bug: wrong assignment here\n            max_index = i + 1\n    \n    return max_index\n\n# Test the function:\ntest_list = [3, 7, 2, 9, 1, 8]\nresult = find_max_index(test_list)\nprint(f\"Max value {max(test_list)} should be at index {test_list.index(max(test_list))}\")\nprint(f\"Function returned index: {result}\")\nprint(f\"Value at returned index: {test_list[result] if result < len(test_list) else 'INDEX OUT OF BOUNDS'}\")",
      "correct_answer": "Change 'max_index = i + 1' to 'max_index = i' on line 12. The bug is adding 1 to the index, causing off-by-one error.",
      "explanation": "The error is in line 12 where 'max_index = i + 1' should be 'max_index = i'. Arrays are zero-indexed, so when we find the maximum at position i, we should store i, not i+1. This off-by-one error causes the function to return an incorrect index.",
      "hint": "Check the line where max_index is updated. Remember that array indices start at 0, not 1 (only if hints enabled: {{ hints_enabled }})",

Focus on errors that are:
- Commonly made by learners of {{ subtopic_title }}
- Representative of important concepts
- Educational when corrected
- Realistic in professional contexts

Ensure examples are relevant to {{ goal }} and appropriate for the subject matter.
