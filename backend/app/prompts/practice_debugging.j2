Generate {{ count }} debugging/error identification questions for practice/exam mode:

Subject: {{ subject }}
Goal: {{ goal }}
Subtopic: {{ subtopic_title }}
Context: {{ context }}
Difficulty Level: Mixed (easy, medium, hard)

Create realistic debugging scenarios with common errors related to {{ subtopic_title }}. Each question should:
1. Present code or statements with subtle but important errors
2. Require identifying what's wrong and why
3. Test understanding of common pitfalls and best practices
4. Include both syntax errors and logical errors
5. Provide clear explanation of the issue and correction

Error types to include:
- Syntax errors (missing punctuation, incorrect keywords)
- Logical errors (wrong operators, incorrect conditions)
- Runtime errors (null references, array bounds)
- Design errors (inefficient algorithms, poor practices)
- Conceptual errors (misapplied principles)

Format the output as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question_text": "Identify the error in the following code/statement and explain what's wrong:",
      "code_snippet": "for i in range(10):\n    if i = 5:\n        print('Found five!')",
      "correct_answer": "The condition 'i = 5' uses assignment (=) instead of comparison (==). It should be 'if i == 5:'",
      "explanation": "The error is using a single equals sign (=) for assignment instead of double equals (==) for comparison. In the if statement, 'i = 5' assigns the value 5 to i rather than checking if i equals 5. This will cause a syntax error in most languages or unexpected behavior.",
      "hint": "Look carefully at the conditional statement - is it checking equality or doing something else? (only if hints enabled: {{ hints_enabled }})",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "error_type": "syntax_error"
    }
  ]
}
```

Focus on errors that are:
- Commonly made by learners of {{ subtopic_title }}
- Representative of important concepts
- Educational when corrected
- Realistic in professional contexts

Ensure examples are relevant to {{ goal }} and appropriate for the subject matter.
