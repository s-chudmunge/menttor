Generate {{ count }} educational code completion questions for practice mode:

Subject: {{ subject }}
Goal: {{ goal }}
Subtopic: {{ subtopic_title }}
Context: {{ context }}
Difficulty Level: Mixed (easy, medium, hard)

Create high-quality educational coding exercises that test real programming concepts. Each question should:

1. **Rich Context**: Provide a clear problem statement that explains WHAT the code should accomplish
2. **Educational Value**: Test important concepts from {{ subtopic_title }} that students actually need to learn
3. **Strategic Gaps**: Place _____ in locations that test understanding, not just syntax memorization
4. **Real-world Relevance**: Use scenarios that programmers encounter in actual development
5. **Clear Completion**: Have one correct answer that demonstrates proper understanding

**Question Types to Generate:**
- Algorithm implementation (sorting, searching, data processing)
- Data structure manipulation (lists, dictionaries, objects)
- Control flow logic (loops, conditionals with real conditions)
- Function design patterns (parameter handling, return values)
- Error handling and edge cases
- API/library usage patterns
- Mathematical computations with context

**Requirements:**
- Provide rich problem context (2-3 sentences explaining the scenario)
- Code snippets should be 8-15 lines with meaningful logic
- Gaps should test conceptual understanding, not trivial syntax
- Include real variable names and realistic scenarios
- Focus on {{ goal }} learning objectives

Format the output as a JSON object:

      "explanation": "Return 0 for empty lists to handle edge cases, then calculate average by dividing total by count",
