Generate {{ count }} educational code completion questions optimized for split-screen code editor interface:

Subject: {{ subject }}
Goal: {{ goal }}
Subtopic: {{ subtopic_title }}
Context: {{ context }}
Difficulty Level: Mixed (easy, medium, hard)

Create high-quality educational coding exercises designed for an interactive IDE-like environment where students can:
- Edit code in a Monaco Editor with syntax highlighting
- Run code and see live execution results
- Get immediate feedback on their implementations

Each question should:

1. **Rich Context**: Provide a clear problem statement that explains WHAT the code should accomplish
2. **Educational Value**: Test important concepts from {{ subtopic_title }} that students actually need to learn
3. **Strategic Comments**: Use `// TODO: Complete this function` or `// COMPLETE THIS` comments instead of _____ blanks
4. **Executable Code**: Ensure the completed code can actually run and produce meaningful output
5. **Testable Logic**: Include example inputs/outputs that can be verified programmatically

**Enhanced Requirements for IDE Interface:**
- Use comment-based completion markers: `// TODO: Implement the logic here`
- Code should be immediately runnable after completion
- Include console.log() or print() statements to show execution results
- Provide realistic function/variable names and scenarios
- Code snippets should be 10-20 lines for better editor experience
- Include example function calls at the end to demonstrate expected output

**Question Types Optimized for Live Coding:**
- Function implementations with test cases
- Algorithm solutions with example inputs
- Data processing with sample data
- API response handling with mock data
- Mathematical calculations with verification steps
- String/array manipulation with output demonstrations

**Code Structure Template:**
```javascript
// Problem context and requirements
function functionName(parameters) {
    // TODO: Implement the main logic here
    
    // TODO: Handle edge cases
    
    return result;
}

// Test your implementation:
console.log(functionName(testInput1)); // Expected: expectedOutput1
console.log(functionName(testInput2)); // Expected: expectedOutput2
```

Format the output as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question_text": "You're building a student grade tracker for a school system. Complete this function that calculates the average grade from a list of scores and handles edge cases appropriately:",
      "code_snippet": "def calculate_average_grade(grades):\n    \"\"\"Calculate average grade with proper edge case handling\"\"\"\n    if len(grades) == 0:\n        # TODO: Handle empty list case\n        return _____\n    \n    total = sum(grades)\n    average = _____  # TODO: Calculate the average\n    \n    return round(average, 2)  # Round to 2 decimal places\n\n# Test your implementation:\nprint(\"Testing grade calculator:\")\nprint(f\"Empty list: {calculate_average_grade([])}\")\nprint(f\"Single grade: {calculate_average_grade([85])}\")\nprint(f\"Multiple grades: {calculate_average_grade([92, 87, 78, 95, 88])}\")\nprint(f\"Mixed grades: {calculate_average_grade([100, 0, 75, 60, 85])}\")",
      "correct_answer": "0\ntotal / len(grades)",
      "explanation": "Return 0 for empty lists to handle edge cases gracefully, then calculate average by dividing total sum by the count of grades. The round() function ensures clean decimal output.",
      "hint": "Think about division by zero errors and the basic average formula: sum divided by count (only if hints enabled: {{ hints_enabled }})",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "programming_language": "python"
    }
