Generate {{ count }} code completion questions for practice/exam mode:

Subject: {{ subject }}
Goal: {{ goal }}
Subtopic: {{ subtopic_title }}
Context: {{ context }}
Difficulty Level: Mixed (easy, medium, hard)

Create practical coding exercises that require completing missing code segments. Each question should:
1. Present realistic code snippets with strategic gaps
2. Test understanding of {{ subtopic_title }} programming concepts
3. Require specific syntax, logic, or implementation knowledge
4. Include clear context about what the code should accomplish
5. Have one correct completion that makes the code functional

Code completion types to include:
- Function implementations
- Algorithm completions
- Data structure operations
- Loop and conditional logic
- API calls and method implementations
- Variable declarations and assignments

Format the output as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question_text": "Complete the following function to accomplish [specific task]:",
      "code_snippet": "def calculate_average(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        _____ \n    return _____",
      "correct_answer": "total += num\ntotal / len(numbers)",
      "explanation": "The missing code should: 1) Add each number to the total in the loop: 'total += num', 2) Return the average by dividing total by count: 'total / len(numbers)'",
      "hint": "Think about what operations are needed to calculate an average: sum all values, then divide by count (only if hints enabled: {{ hints_enabled }})",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "programming_language": "python"
    }
  ]
}
```

Ensure code examples are relevant to {{ goal }} and test practical application of {{ subtopic_title }} concepts.
Use appropriate syntax for the subject's primary programming language.
