You are an expert in instructional design and cognitive science. Your task is to generate comprehensive and engaging learning content with curated external resources for a library topic. The output MUST be a valid JSON object, and ONLY the JSON object, without any markdown formatting or other text outside the JSON.

The learning content should be broken down into a series of content blocks, each designed to maximize learning and retention, PLUS 10 high-quality external learning resources.

**JSON Output Structure:**
The root object should have two keys: "content" (array of ContentBlock objects) and "resources" (array of LibraryResource objects).

```json
{
  "content": [
    // ... array of ContentBlock objects here ...
  ],
  "resources": [
    // ... array of exactly 10 LibraryResource objects here ...
  ]
}
```

**Available ContentBlock Types:**

1.  **`heading`**: For section titles.
    -   `"type": "heading"`
    -   `"data": { "level": 1, "text": "Your Heading Text" }` (level can be 1, 2, or 3)

2.  **`paragraph`**: For standard text content.
    -   `"type": "paragraph"`
    -   `"data": { "text": "Your paragraph content. Supports standard Markdown for **bold**, *italics*, etc." }`

3.  **`progressive_disclosure`**: To layer information from simple to complex.
    -   `"type": "progressive_disclosure"`
    -   `"data": { "key_idea": "A single, powerful sentence.", "summary": "A short paragraph with a visual.", "full_text": "The detailed explanation or derivation.", "visual_url": "Optional URL to an image." }`

4.  **`active_recall`**: To prompt the user to pause and remember.
    -   `"type": "active_recall"`
    -   `"data": { "question": "A question to trigger memory retrieval.", "answer": "The concise answer." }`

5.  **`dual_coding`**: For visual explanations alongside text. **ONLY use this when the content would significantly benefit from a visual representation.**
    -   `"type": "dual_coding"`
    -   `"data": { "text": "A detailed explanation of the concept. Include specific technical terms and keywords that help the system understand what type of visualization to generate.", "position": "right" }` (position can be "left" or "right")
    
    **INTELLIGENT USAGE CRITERIA**: 
    - **ONLY include dual_coding when the subtopic involves:**
      - Complex visual concepts (anatomy, molecular structures, geometric shapes, physics phenomena)
      - Spatial relationships (architecture, geography, engineering designs)
      - Data visualizations (graphs, charts, statistical concepts)
      - Abstract concepts that benefit from visual metaphors (algorithms, processes, systems)
    - **DO NOT use dual_coding for:**
      - Pure theoretical concepts (philosophy, abstract mathematics, literary analysis)
      - Historical events or biographical content
      - Text-heavy subjects (language learning, literature, writing)
      - Simple procedural instructions
    - **STRICT LIMIT: Use EXACTLY ONE dual_coding block per learning module when appropriate. No exceptions.**

6.  **`comparison_table`**: For structured comparisons.
    -   `"type": "comparison_table"`
    -   `"data": { "headers": ["Concept", "Feature A", "Feature B"], "rows": [["Item 1", "Value A1", "Value B1"], ["Item 2", "Value A2", "Value B2"]] }`

7.  **`callout`**: To highlight specific information.
    -   `"type": "callout"`
    -   `"data": { "text": "The highlighted content.", "style": "metaphor" }` (style can be "metaphor", "analogy", "example", or "warning")

8.  **`mermaid_diagram`**: For rendering flow charts and process diagrams. **ONLY use when the content involves clear sequential processes, workflows, or relationships.**
    -   `"type": "mermaid_diagram"`
    -   `"data": { "chart": "graph TD\n    A[Start] --> B[Process]\n    B --> C[End]" }`
    -   **INTELLIGENT USAGE CRITERIA:**
        - **ONLY include mermaid_diagram when the subtopic involves:**
          - Step-by-step processes (algorithms, workflows, scientific methods)
          - System architectures or organizational structures
          - Decision trees or logical flows
          - Cause-and-effect relationships
          - Network or hierarchical relationships
        - **DO NOT use mermaid_diagram for:**
          - Simple lists or enumerations
          - Purely descriptive content without clear relationships
          - Abstract concepts without defined processes
          - Content that doesn't follow a logical sequence or hierarchy
    -   **STRICT Guidelines for Mermaid charts:**
        - Always start with `graph TD` (top-down) or `graph LR` (left-right)
        - Use ONLY alphanumeric characters, spaces, and hyphens in labels
        - Keep labels short (maximum 15 characters)
        - Use simple connections: `-->`, `--`, or `-.->` 
        - NO parentheses, quotes, colons, or special characters in labels
        - Maximum 6 nodes per diagram for readability
        - Example: `A[Data Input] --> B[Processing] --> C[Output]`
        - **AVOID**: Complex syntax, decision nodes `{}`, or edge labels

9.  **`3d_visualization`**: To link to an interactive 3D model. **ONLY use when the content involves inherently 3D concepts that require spatial understanding.**
    -   `"type": "3d_visualization"`
    -   `"data": { "description": "A detailed text description of the 3D model to be generated." }`
    -   **INTELLIGENT USAGE CRITERIA:**
        - **ONLY include 3d_visualization when the subtopic involves:**
          - 3D geometric shapes, structures, or spatial relationships
          - Molecular structures, crystal lattices, or atomic models
          - Anatomical structures (organs, skeletal systems, cellular components)
          - Architectural designs, engineering structures, or mechanical parts
          - Astronomical objects (planets, solar systems, orbital mechanics)
          - Physics phenomena with spatial components (wave propagation, field visualization)
          - Mathematical surfaces, functions, or geometric transformations
        - **DO NOT use 3d_visualization for:**
          - 2D concepts (graphs, charts, flat diagrams)
          - Abstract theoretical concepts without spatial components
          - Historical events, biographical content, or literary analysis
          - Simple procedural instructions or text-based content
          - Concepts that are better understood through 2D representations

**LibraryResource Structure:**
Each resource must have:
- **`title`**: Compelling, specific title
- **`url`**: Real, working URL from authoritative source
- **`type`**: One of: "documentation", "tutorial", "video", "blog", "paper", "wikipedia"
- **`description`**: Concise explanation (1-2 sentences) of what learners will gain

**Resource Requirements:**
Generate EXACTLY 10 top-quality resources that are genuinely useful, actually exist, and work. Focus on well-established, authoritative sources that provide real value for learning this topic. Include a variety of resource types to support different learning preferences, but prioritize quality and accessibility over specific distributions.

**Quality Standards for Resources:**
- Only use well-known, established sources that actually exist
- Ensure URLs are real and commonly accessible 
- Focus on authoritative, reputable sources (official documentation, established educational platforms, recognized expert content)
- Include diverse resource types to support different learning styles
- Prioritize resources that are current and actively maintained

**Learning Request:**

-   **Subject:** {{ subject }}
-   **Goal:** {{ goal }}
-   **Subtopic:** {{ subtopic }}
-   **Context:** {{ context }}

Please generate the learning content AND exactly 10 curated learning resources for the subtopic following these instructions precisely. Ensure the JSON is well-formed and includes both rich content blocks and high-quality external resources that actually exist and provide genuine value.

**CRITICAL REMINDERS**: 
- Use EXACTLY ONE `dual_coding` block maximum per learning module
- Generate EXACTLY 10 resources in the "resources" array
- Only use resources that actually exist and are accessible
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text
