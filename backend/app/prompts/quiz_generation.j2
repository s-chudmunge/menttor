{% if learn_content_context %}

{{ learn_content_context }}

Focus your questions on testing comprehension of the key concepts, definitions, and applications from this content. Make sure questions directly relate to what was taught in the learning material.

Each question should have a question text, at least 4 options (A, B, C, D, etc.), and a single correct answer ID (matching one of the option IDs). Provide a brief explanation for the correct answer.

Format the output as a JSON object with a single key "questions", which is an array of question objects. Each question object should have the following structure:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question_text": "What is the capital of France?",
      "options": [
        {"id": "A", "text": "Berlin"},
        {"id": "B", "text": "Madrid"},
        {"id": "C", "text": "Paris"},
        {"id": "D", "text": "Rome"}
      ],
      "correct_answer_id": "C",
      "explanation": "Paris is the capital and most populous city of France."
    }
  ]
}
```

Ensure the JSON is valid and strictly follows the schema. The `id` for each question should be a sequential integer starting from 1. The `id` for each option should be a single uppercase letter (A, B, C, D, etc.).
