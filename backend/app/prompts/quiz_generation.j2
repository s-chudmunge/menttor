Generate a multiple-choice quiz based on the following parameters:

Subject: {{ subject }}
Topic: {{ topic_title }}
Sub-topic: {{ sub_topic_title }}
Goal: {{ goal }}
Number of questions: {{ num_questions }}

Each question should have a question text, at least 4 options (A, B, C, D, etc.), and a single correct answer ID (matching one of the option IDs). Provide a brief explanation for the correct answer.

Format the output as a JSON object with a single key "questions", which is an array of question objects. Each question object should have the following structure:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question_text": "What is the capital of France?",
      "options": [
        {"id": "A", "text": "Berlin"},
        {"id": "B", "text": "Madrid"},
        {"id": "C", "text": "Paris"},
        {"id": "D", "text": "Rome"}
      ],
      "correct_answer_id": "C",
      "explanation": "Paris is the capital and most populous city of France."
    }
  ]
}
```

Ensure the JSON is valid and strictly follows the schema. The `id` for each question should be a sequential integer starting from 1. The `id` for each option should be a single uppercase letter (A, B, C, D, etc.).
