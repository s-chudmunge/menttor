Generate {{ count }} multiple-choice questions for practice/exam mode based on the following parameters:

Subject: {{ subject }}
Goal: {{ goal }}
Subtopic: {{ subtopic_title }}
Context: {{ context }}
Difficulty Level: Mixed (easy, medium, hard)

Create engaging, practical questions that test understanding and application of the subtopic concepts. Each question should:
1. Have a clear, well-structured question text
2. Include 4 options (A, B, C, D) with only one correct answer
3. Have plausible distractors that test common misconceptions
4. Include a brief, educational explanation for the correct answer
5. Optionally include a helpful hint if hints are enabled: {{ hints_enabled }}

Vary the difficulty across questions:
- Easy: Basic recall and understanding (30%)
- Medium: Application and analysis (50%) 
- Hard: Synthesis and evaluation (20%)

Format the output as a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question_text": "Clear, specific question about {{ subtopic_title }}",
      "options": [
        {"id": "A", "text": "First option"},
        {"id": "B", "text": "Second option"},
        {"id": "C", "text": "Third option (correct)"},
        {"id": "D", "text": "Fourth option"}
      ],
      "correct_answer_id": "C",
      "explanation": "Brief explanation of why C is correct and why others are wrong",
      "hint": "Helpful hint without giving away the answer (only if hints enabled)",
      "difficulty": "medium"
    }
  ]
}
```

Ensure all questions are directly relevant to {{ subtopic_title }} and align with the goal: {{ goal }}.
