In these architectures, information moves in a single direction - from the input layer through one or more hidden layers to the output layer. Each neuron in a layer is connected to every neuron in the subsequent layer, but there are no connections within the same layer or backwards. This unidirectional flow makes feedforward networks particularly suitable for tasks like classification and regression, where the goal is to map inputs to outputs without considering temporal dependencies."

This allows the model to directly access information from any part of the sequence, regardless of distance, solving the long-range dependency problem that plagued RNNs. The 'multi-head' aspect means this attention computation is performed multiple times in parallel, allowing the model to focus on different types of relationships simultaneously."
